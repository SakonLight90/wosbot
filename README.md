## 🛠️ How to Compile & Run

### To Compile:

```sh
mvn clean install package
```
This will generate a `.jar` file in the `wos-hmi/target` directory.

### To Run:

#### From the Command Line (Recommended)
Running from the command line allows you to see real-time logs, which is helpful for debugging.
```sh
# Navigate to the target directory and run the bot
java -jar wos-bot-x.x.x.jar
```

#### With a Double-Click
You can also run the bot by double-clicking the `wos-bot-x.x.x.jar` file. Note that this will not display a console for logs.
